## About

It is my goal to build an astronomical interferomter. The first step in building that interferomter is to learn how to process images. This project is just that, a way for me to get into image processing at  abasic level and learning about various file formats. While the VSA project will have signal processing instead of image processing, I believe this is a great place to start. 

## Warning

The file you input will be modified accordingly. It does not currently make a new file and rewrites your file. Also, I have not tested this with file sizes larger than BMP files with 4k resolution. Undesired outcomes may arise.
